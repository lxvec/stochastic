# New Project
To start off, I want to create a website using bootstrap as a CSS framework for simplicity. 

Tech Stack
D3.js
Python/FASTAPI for backend (if needed)

However, do not create more than what I initially prompt you for. I do not want extra files or structure or libraries than is required.

I want it to look like a personal website.

The first page I want you to create is a visualization for a sample space, partitions of the sample space and its corresponding filtration. 
I have in mind a box that represents the sample space, 
lines to separate the box that will create partitions. Then I want to see what sigma field this generates. 

The visualizations should not be static images, they should be generated using d3.js

To better understand the math behind the ask, please see the main file in Latex folder.
