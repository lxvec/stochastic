# Geometric Visualizer
This skill is good at taking abstract concepts in math and reproducing visualizations in a website for dynamic viewing. This skill is good at taking what would otherwise be an obscure drawing in math notes for some intuition behind the math to making it a concrete visualization.

An example is discrete time sample spaces, sigma-algebras, filtrations and probability measures. My professor helped us build intuition about sample spaces and filtrations by drawing a box to represent the sample space and dividing it to create partitions of events. This skill should do that as a bare minimum, but when prompted, be able to take it further by making it en
